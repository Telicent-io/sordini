# kafkaesque

A really simple Python library for serialising objects and dictionaries to Apache Kafka. It has been designed with containers in mind, so the defaults can be set by environment variables, but also overriden when the library is called. 

The initial development effort to produce this library was sponsored by Dstl.

License is simple old MIT.
